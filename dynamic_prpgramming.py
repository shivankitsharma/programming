Dynamic Programming (bottom-up tabulation) on two kinds of problems:
1.(Non-optimization) counting problems
 - Overlapping subproblems
2.(Combinatorial Optimization) problems where we found the "best" sequence

 - Overlapping subproblems
 - Optimal substructure (required for correctness)
Both these problems would otherwise (without DP) lead to exponential time
complexity, since the number of possible sequences to consider are far too many.
